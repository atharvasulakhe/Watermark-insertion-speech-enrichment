ABSTRACT-
In todayâ€™s era, it has become extremely important to protect your data, of any form. Digital media today can be easily hacked and used wrongly with misuse of copyright. In this paper, we have understood the importance and the need for watermarking, which enables verification as well as copyright protection. There are several methods for watermarking of audio signals, but in this paper, we have gone with the Least Significant Bit method (LSB). We have discussed the algorithm for watermark insertion as well as extraction using the method mentioned. At the same time, presence of noise corrupts a speech and degrades its quality. Here comes the need for speech enhancement. We have gone with Kalman filter for this task which is an efficient recursive filter that is capable of calculating the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a number of noisy quantifications.
